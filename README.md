# STADVDB-QueryProcessing

The project aimed to streamline data processing using Apache NiFi for ETL operations on the SeriousMD dataset, organizing it into a star schema data warehouse, and utilizing Tableau for visual analytics to create dashboards. Functional and performance testing validated improvements in query execution time through proper formulation and the use of foreign key indexing.
